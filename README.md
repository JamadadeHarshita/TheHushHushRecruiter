# The HushHush Recruiter

### Developed by Team 05: Insight Impactors  
**SRH University – Big Data Programming**

---

## Project Overview

The **HushHush Recruiter** is a recruitment automation system designed to streamline the candidate selection and evaluation process for IT companies. The system automates many aspects of recruitment, including candidate screening, coding challenge evaluation, and communication through email.

### Problem Statement
Modern recruitment processes can be cumbersome, requiring significant manual effort in candidate screening, coding challenge evaluation, and feedback. The **HushHush Recruiter** aims to solve this by automating these processes using machine learning and a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

### Candidate Features:
- **User-Friendly Coding Interface:**  
  Candidates can write and submit code through an easy-to-use interface.
  
- **Email Notifications:**  
  Candidates receive an email confirmation upon submission of their coding challenges.
  
- **Feedback After Evaluation:**  
  The system sends feedback to the candidates, including their scores and whether they’ve been selected.

### Technical Manager Features:
- **Randomized Coding Challenges:**  
  Three coding challenges are implemented, which are randomly assigned to candidates.
  
- **Evaluation of Submitted Solutions:**  
  Managers can evaluate the submitted coding challenges and provide feedback.

### HR Features:
- **ML-Based Candidate Screening:**  
  The system runs a machine learning model to fetch top candidates based on job requirements.
  
- **Email Notifications for Shortlisting and Submissions:**  
  The system sends emails to shortlisted candidates and provides confirmation after they submit their coding challenges.

## Machine Learning Models
- **K-Means Clustering:**  
  Used for labeling candidates by creating clusters.
  
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):**  
  Reduced feature dimensions to improve visualization and processing.
  
- **Logistic Regression:**  
  Implemented for classifying candidates after clustering.

## Architecture

The **HushHush Recruiter** system integrates a machine learning backend with a Flask application to handle database interactions, ML processes, and a user-friendly interface.
